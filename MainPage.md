# Introduction #

Inferno-ds is a port of [inferno](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/) to the [nintendo ds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS).  This project is very much work in progress.  It was started as a google summer of code project in 2007.

Currently, an inferno kernel can be booted, and simple dis programs can be run.  But there is a lot of work left to do!  See the [DSPortStatus](DSPortStatus.md) page for more details, and short- and long-term todo's.  See the [DSContrib](DSContrib.md) page for details on how to program and help out.

Code for inferno can be retrieved from [inferno-os](http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/checkout).

# Mailing list/News/Misc #

The mailing list at [inferno ds mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/inferno-ds) is used for project communication.  You might also find a few programmers on #inferno on irc.freenode.net.

Updates are sometimes sent to the mailing list, or you can find changes in the svn change log.  New test kernels and patches are sometimes uploaded to the download page.

For each commit, a mail is sent out to the [inferno-ds-changes mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/inferno-ds-changes) (a read-only mailing list, so spamless).

# Programming the nds #

Documentation on how to program the nintendo ds is gathered at [TechnicalBackground](TechnicalBackground.md).  It includes descriptions of the registers for the devices and tutorials (though usually geared towards game developers).

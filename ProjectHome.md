# Overview #

Inferno DS is a port of the [Inferno Operating system](http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/) to the Nintendo DS.

Inferno DS aims to use the distributed nature of Inferno with the variety of input methods,
for the hardware capabilities of the DS like wifi, touchscreen, graphics & audio (see [TechnicalBackground](TechnicalBackground.md)) to create new and interesting ways of interacting with computational resources.

The [GsocProjectIdeas](GsocProjectIdeas.md) wiki page includes some application examples like gaming, VoIP, jukebox and accessing remote resources using the [styx(5)](http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/man/5/0intro.html) protocol.

See the _``Inferno DS: Inferno port to the Nintendo DS''_ ([infds.pdf](http://inferno-ds.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/infds.pdf)) for a more complete description of the DS port.

As progress is made we release runnable .nds files (see [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/downloads/list) section), you also should have a look at the
[README](http://code.google.com/p/inferno-ds/source/browse/trunk/README).
